## Make Your Upgrade Plan

KubeSphere 3.3 is compatible with Kubernetes v1.20.x, v1.21.x, * v1.22.x, * v1.23.x, and * v1.24.x:

- Before you upgrade your cluster to KubeSphere 3.3, you need to have a KubeSphere cluster running v3.2.x.
- You can choose to only upgrade KubeSphere to 3.3 or upgrade Kubernetes (to a higher version) and KubeSphere (to 3.3) at the same time.
- For Kubernetes versions with an asterisk, some features of edge nodes may be unavailable due to incompatability. Therefore, if you want to use edge nodes, you are advised to install Kubernetes v1.21.x.
## Before the Upgrade

{{< notice warning >}}

- You are supposed to implement a simulation for the upgrade in a testing environment first. After the upgrade is successful in the testing environment and all applications are running normally, upgrade your cluster in your production environment.
- During the upgrade process, there may be a short interruption of applications (especially for those single-replica Pods). Please arrange a reasonable period of time for your upgrade.
- It is recommended to back up etcd and stateful applications before in production. You can use [Velero](https://velero.io/) to implement the backup and migrate Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes.

## Upgrade Tool

Depending on how your existing cluster was set up, you can use KubeKey or ks-installer to upgrade your cluster. It is recommended that you [use KubeKey to upgrade your cluster](../upgrade-with-kubekey/) if it was created by KubeKey. Otherwise, [use ks-installer to upgrade your cluster](../upgrade-with-ks-installer/).
